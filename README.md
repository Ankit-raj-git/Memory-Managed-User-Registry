# Memory-Managed-User-Registry
A C++ CLI user registry featuring manual heap memory management, LIFO data structures, and zero memory leaks. Built on Ubuntu.



# Memory-Managed User Registry

A high-performance C++ CLI application designed to manage user records using custom memory management and a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure. Developed and tested on **Ubuntu Linux**.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
- **Manual Memory Management:** Implemented custom heap allocation logic to handle dynamic user records, ensuring high efficiency and control over system resources.
- **Zero Memory Leaks:** Features a robust **Class Destructor** that ensures 100% deallocation of all dynamic nodes upon program termination.
- **LIFO Data Structure:** Utilizes a **Singly Linked List** logic for $O(1)$ time complexity on user record insertions.
- **Input Validation:** Built-in protection against input buffer overflows to ensure stability during runtime.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Compiler:** g++
- **Version Control:** Git
